You hang there on the wall
You've carved out your place
But I can tell you shake from inside

I see it all the time
The feel is always there
Just frozen in your mind, from inside

[Chorus]
I wasn't gonna play it tonight
But I can't help it the feeling's alive
As long as you play my game, I'll let you win
[Verse 2]
Before your entrance wave
Before we play this game
I like to feel you break from inside

You're gold and pink inside
And it's showing through your stare
It's frozen us in time, from inside
